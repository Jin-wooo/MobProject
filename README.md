## Warning!
> This program does not work properly on a PC. Debugging is also impossible. This is because there is a problem with the code, but Kakao Map API must only work in a mobile environment. So, use the code only to see how it was written, and if you want to see how it actually works, you can check it by installing app-release.apk in the ADDITIONAL directory. The part I made is MapActivity, so I can guarantee that part works, but other parts may not work.
